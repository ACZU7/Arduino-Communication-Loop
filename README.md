# Arduino Communication Loop

This repository contains an **Arduino communication loop** written in C++ as part of the *Computer Systems Architecture* module.

## Files
- **Arduino_Communication_Loop.cpp** — main communication loop code (C++)  
- **Omar_Fathy.ino** — Arduino sketch version of the code  

## Usage
1. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE (or copy from the `.cpp` file).  
2. Connect your Arduino board via USB.  
3. Upload the code to the board.  
4. Open the **Serial Monitor** to observe the communication loop in action.
