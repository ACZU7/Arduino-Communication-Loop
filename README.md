# Arduino Communication Loop

This repository contains an Arduino communication loop code developed as part of the **Computer Systems Architecture** module.  
It demonstrates a simple loop for sending and receiving data between the Arduino and external devices.

## File
- **Arduino Communication Loop Code.txt** â€” the main code file.

## Usage
1. Open the file in the **Arduino IDE** (or copy its contents into a new `.ino` sketch).
2. Connect your Arduino board via USB.
3. Upload the code to the board.
4. Open the **Serial Monitor** (Ctrl + Shift + M) to observe communication.

## About
This project was created for coursework and demonstrates fundamental Arduino communication principles.
